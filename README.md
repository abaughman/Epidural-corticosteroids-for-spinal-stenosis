Epidural corticosteroids for spinal stenosis: a living systematic review
============================================

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that the clinical intervention is *not clearly effective* at 4-6 weeks. Effect noted by Fukusaki at one week from corticosteroids is similar to the effect of local anesthetics. However, the quality of evidence is *low* ([see methods](https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/_Methods/blob/master/README.md)) due to imprecision of results and the heterogeneity or inconsistency of results. Additional interpretations may be in the references in the 'Cited by' section below.

**Methods overview:** This repository contains the [source data](../../tree/master/data), matching [forest plots](../../tree/master/forest%20plots) and  [GRADE profiles](../../tree/master/GRADE%20profiles) for an [open  MetaAnalysis](https://openMetaAnalysis) of this intervention. This repository updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer trials included are listed below in the references. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.  See [methods](https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/_Methods/blob/master/README.md) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the [PICO table](../../wiki/PICO-Table) and [risk of bias table](../../wiki/Risk-of-bias-table). Rationale for studies excluded may be listed at the end of the references below.  See [see methods](https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/_Methods/blob/master/README.md) for details.
